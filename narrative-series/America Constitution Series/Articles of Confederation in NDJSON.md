The committee of the states, or any nine of them, shall be authorized to execute, in the recess of congress, such of the powers of congress as the united states, in congress assembled, by the consent of nine states, shall, from time to time, think expedient to vest them with; provided that no power be delegated to the said committee, for the exercise of which, by the articles of confederation, the voice of nine states, in the congress of the united states assembled, is requisite.

Article XI. Canada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the measures of the united states, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this union: but no other colony shall be admitted into the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine states.

Note about the extraction:

· The document begins with a lengthy preamble and includes all 13 Articles of Confederation
· Complex sentences with multiple clauses have been broken down into their core subject-predicate-object relationships
· For sentences with implied subjects, I've included them in brackets [] to maintain grammatical completeness
· Article IX contains extensive procedural details that have been separated into individual statements
· The ratification clause at the end is broken into multiple sentences
