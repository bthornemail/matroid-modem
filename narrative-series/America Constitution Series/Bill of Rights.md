On September 25, 1789, the First Congress of the United States proposed 12 amendments to the Constitution. The 1789 Joint Resolution of Congress proposing the amendments is on display in the Rotunda in the National Archives Museum. Ten of the proposed 12 amendments were ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures on December 15, 1791. The ratified Articles (Articles 3–12) constitute the first 10 amendments of the Constitution, or the U.S. Bill of Rights. In 1992, 203 years after it was proposed, Article 2 was ratified as the 27th Amendment to the Constitution. Article 1 was never ratified.

THE Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution.

Note about the extraction:

· The document contains both the introductory/historical notes and the full text of the amendments (which appear twice - first in the proposed articles, then as the ratified Bill of Rights)
· For sentences with implied subjects or objects, I've included them in brackets [] to maintain grammatical completeness
· Complex sentences have been broken down into their core subject-predicate-object relationships
· Each amendment's provisions are broken into separate logical statements where appropriate
· The signers' names at the end are listed as names, not as sentences requiring extraction
