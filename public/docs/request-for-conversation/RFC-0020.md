# RFC-0020

# Semantic Consensus Without Blockchain v1.0

## Drift-Weighted Matroid Convergence Protocol

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0005, RFC-0010, RFC-0018

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines a consensus mechanism based on:

* Matroid independence
* Drift metrics
* Proof-carrying federation
* Deterministic replay

No global ledger or blockchain required.

---

# 2. Consensus Model

Each node maintains:

```id="sc1"
Ledger L
Independent Set I = 𝓜(L)
```

Nodes exchange:

* closure_proofs
* drift reports
* independent set hashes

---

# 3. Convergence Condition

Two nodes A and B are converged iff:

```id="sc2"
hash(I_A) == hash(I_B)
```

Where:

```id="sc3"
hash(I) = sha256(sorted(self_hashes))
```

---

# 4. Admission Rule

Upon receiving foreign event e:

Add to candidate set only if:

```id="sc4"
proof_valid(e)
∧ drift ≤ threshold
∧ no circuit introduced
```

---

# 5. Quorum-Free Consensus

No majority required.

Consensus emerges when:

* Nodes independently derive identical independent sets.

This is *structural consensus*, not vote-based.

---

# 6. Drift-Based Stabilization

If drift oscillates:

Nodes may:

```id="sc5"
tighten DRIFT_MAX
```

Until convergence stabilizes.

---

# 7. Conflict Handling

If circuit detected:

```id="sc6"
prefer event with:
  lower drift
  higher proof depth
  stronger trust weight
```

---

# 8. Eventual Convergence Theorem

If:

* registry identical
* drift metric identical
* deterministic matroid selection

Then independent sets will converge without coordination.

---

# 9. Liveness Constraint

Nodes must:

* periodically broadcast independent set hash
* periodically request missing proofs

---

# 10. Security Model

Consensus depends on:

* proof validation
* deterministic replay
* drift metric consistency

No stake, mining, or chain reorg required.
