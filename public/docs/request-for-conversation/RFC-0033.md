# RFC-0033

# Emergent Mythopoetic Layer

## Narrative as Governance Memory

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0019, RFC-0028

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines a layer above canonical triples where:

* stories encode governance memory
* characters model epistemic roles
* narratives preserve interpretive continuity

Without altering canonical truth.

---

# 2. Canon vs Myth Distinction

| Layer        | Mutable | Canonical | Deterministic                  |
| ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Civic Triple | No      | Yes       | Yes                            |
| Narrative    | Yes     | No        | Must compile deterministically |

Narratives must compile to civic_triples deterministically.

---

# 3. Mythopoetic Object

```json
{
  "type":"narrative_fragment",
  "characters":["Solon","Solomon","Asabiyyah","Enoch"],
  "compiled_triples":[...],
  "author":"0x...",
  "drift_analysis":0.04
}
```

---

# 4. Character Roles

Characters encode epistemic faces:

| Character      | Face     | Role                 |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| Solon          | Logic    | structural reasoning |
| Solomon        | Ethics   | judgment             |
| Asabiyyah      | Agency   | collective cohesion  |
| Enoch/Metatron | Centroid | integration          |

Narrative dialogues must map to SPO triples.

---

# 5. Mythopoetic Stability Rule

Narrative may:

* interpret
* dramatize
* contextualize

But may not contradict canonical triples.

Contradiction triggers:

```text
myth_circuit_event
```

---

# 6. Governance Memory

Narrative fragments stored alongside ledger as:

```text
type: myth_memory
linked_commit: ...
```

They serve as:

* interpretive explanation
* cultural continuity
* reflection material

---

# 7. Narrative Drift

Narrative drift tolerated higher than canonical drift.

But must not introduce canonical falsehood.

---

# 8. Mythopoetic Compilation Requirement

Every narrative fragment must compile to deterministic triple set.

---

# 9. Cultural Continuity Principle

> Myth preserves meaning; canon preserves truth.

---

# 10. Emergence Rule

Narrative clusters may create:

```text
semantic_attractors
```

These influence interpretation but not independence logic.
