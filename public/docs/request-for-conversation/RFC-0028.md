# RFC-0028

# Human-Machine Co-Authorship Model v1.0

## Deterministic Joint Canon Extension

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0019, RFC-0025

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how humans and agents co-author narrative and canonical extensions.

Maintains:

* deterministic replay
* proof validation
* policy adherence

---

# 2. Co-Author Roles

| Role            | Authority                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Human Author    | proposes narrative changes |
| Agent Compiler  | extracts triples           |
| Agent Validator | checks types & drift       |
| Matroid Engine  | final arbiter              |

---

# 3. Proposal Record

```json
{
  "type":"canon_extension_proposal",
  "author":"0xabc...",
  "content_hash":"sha256-...",
  "proposed_triples":[...],
  "agent_proofs":[...]
}
```

---

# 4. Co-Authorship Flow

1. Human writes text
2. Compiler agent produces civic_triples
3. Type inference validates
4. Closure resolution performed
5. Proof certificates attached
6. Matroid filter determines inclusion

---

# 5. Narrative Layer

Narrative may include:

* character dialogues
* constitutional analysis
* philosophical commentary

Only civic_triples enter canonical layer.

---

# 6. Attribution

Each triple retains:

```json
{
  "human_author":"0xabc...",
  "agent_compiler":"agent-01"
}
```

---

# 7. Deterministic Constraint

Agent outputs must be reproducible with:

* fixed model version
* fixed temperature
* fixed seed

Else invalid.

---

# 8. Conflict Resolution

If human and agent disagree:

Matroid + drift decide.

Not human override.

Not agent override.

---

# 9. Extension Acceptance Rule

Extension admitted iff:

* passes type inference
* passes proof validation
* introduces no forbidden circuit
* adheres to governance policy

---

# 10. Co-Authorship Invariant

> Canon extension must remain replayable and hash-stable.
