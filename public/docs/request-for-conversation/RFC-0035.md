# RFC-0035

# Ontological Death & World Dissolution

## Formal Termination of a Semantic World

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0026, RFC-0032

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines when and how a world:

* ceases to admit new canonical events
* archives itself
* forks into successors
* or collapses permanently

Without corrupting replay integrity.

---

# 2. Definition of Ontological Death

A world W is ontologically dead iff:

```text
no_valid_independent_extension exists
∧ constitutional invariants prevent amendment
∧ convergence_index < threshold for N cycles
```

Meaning:

* all new proposals form circuits
* drift cannot be reconciled
* governance cannot repair instability

---

# 3. Dissolution Event

```json
{
  "type": "world_dissolution",
  "worldHash": "...",
  "reason": "irreconcilable constitutional conflict",
  "final_commit": "...",
  "successor_worlds": ["hashA","hashB"]
}
```

---

# 4. Modes of Dissolution

### 4.1 Natural Completion

World reaches semantic equilibrium:

```text
no_new_information ∧ convergence → 1.0
```

World freezes as archive.

---

### 4.2 Constitutional Lock

Amendment impossible under invariants.

Forces fork.

---

### 4.3 Divergence Collapse

Persistent high drift:

```text
avg_drift > DRIFT_MAX for N cycles
```

Triggers forced dissolution.

---

# 5. Archival Integrity

Upon death:

* ledger frozen
* resurrection bundle finalized
* canonical narrative sealed
* worldHash immutable

---

# 6. No Deletion Principle

Worlds cannot be erased.

Only:

* archived
* forked
* superseded

---

# 7. Succession Rule

Successor world must declare:

```text
parent_worldHash
inherited_basisHash
new_constitutionHash
```

---

# 8. Ontological Finality Invariant

> A dissolved world remains replayable forever.

---

# 9. Dissolution Without Chaos

Dissolution must not break:

* replay determinism
* identity proofs
* treaty commitments

---

# 10. Death Principle

> A world ends when it can no longer coherently extend itself.
