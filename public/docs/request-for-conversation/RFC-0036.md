# RFC-0036

# Semantic Evolution Dynamics

## Formal Mechanism of World Adaptation

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0027, RFC-0026

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how worlds evolve without dissolving.

Evolution = controlled structural adaptation.

---

# 2. Evolution Definition

Evolution occurs when:

```text
amendment adopted
∧ independence preserved
∧ convergence restored
```

---

# 3. Evolution Operator

Let Wₙ be world state at commit n.

Evolution step:

```text
Wₙ₊₁ = Wₙ ⊕ Δ
```

Where Δ satisfies:

* no invariant violation
* matroid rank preserved
* drift bounded

---

# 4. Adaptive Drift Recalibration

If environment shifts:

```text
DRIFT_MAX_new = f(avg_drift_history)
```

Must remain within constitutional limits.

---

# 5. Dimensional Evolution

Basis expansion allowed if:

```text
rank_new = rank_old + 1
```

And type inference decidable.

---

# 6. Selective Pressure

World selects stable closures:

* frequently independent closures persist
* unstable closures accumulate circuits and fade

This mirrors evolutionary selection.

---

# 7. Evolution Stability Metric

```text
E_stability = convergence_index / avg_drift
```

World evolves only if stability improves.

---

# 8. Non-Regressive Rule

Evolution must not:

* reduce replay determinism
* reduce proof validation integrity

---

# 9. Adaptive Forking

If two adaptive paths diverge:

Fork under RFC-0022.

Evolution without coercion.

---

# 10. Evolution Principle

> Evolution is drift bounded by invariants.
