# RFC-0027

# Cognitive Self-Reflection Protocol v1.0

## Worlds Observing Themselves

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0025, RFC-0021

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines mechanisms allowing a world to:

* analyze its own drift
* analyze its convergence
* detect policy instability
* evaluate agent influence

Without breaking determinism.

---

# 2. Reflection Event

```json
{
  "type":"self_reflection",
  "worldHash":"...",
  "metrics":{
    "avg_drift":0.07,
    "circuit_rate":0.02,
    "convergence_index":0.91,
    "agent_entropy":0.15
  }
}
```

---

# 3. Reflection Metrics

### 3.1 Average Drift

Mean D_total across independent set.

### 3.2 Circuit Rate

```text
circuit_events / total_events
```

### 3.3 Convergence Index

```text
number_of_nodes_converged / total_nodes
```

### 3.4 Agent Entropy

Variance of agent proposals accepted.

---

# 4. Reflection Scheduling

Reflection occurs:

* every N logical commits
* before amendment proposals
* before federation merges

---

# 5. Meta-Matroid

Reflection events themselves enter matroid ground set.

Self-reflection must not introduce dependency cycles.

---

# 6. Instability Detection

If:

```text
avg_drift rising ∧ convergence falling
```

System enters:

```text
stability_alert_mode
```

---

# 7. Self-Healing Actions

May:

* tighten drift threshold
* increase proof requirements
* quarantine unstable agents

---

# 8. Reflexive Invariant

> Reflection must not mutate ledger directly — only propose adjustments.

---

# 9. Observer Neutrality

Metatron (centroid face) is default reflection character.

---

# 10. Recursive Depth Limit

Self-reflection cannot recurse beyond depth 2.

Prevents infinite reflexive loops.
