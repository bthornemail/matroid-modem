## Value Without Tokens

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0020, RFC-0023

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how value is measured and exchanged without cryptocurrency tokens.

Value is derived from:

* proof contribution
* drift minimization
* closure quality
* convergence stabilization

---

# 2. Value Definition

Define value function:

```text
V(e) = w1·proof_strength
     + w2·drift_reduction
     + w3·circuit_resolution
     + w4·convergence_contribution
```

---

# 3. Proof Strength

Measured by:

* depth of closure proof chain
* registry stability
* replay equivalence across nodes

---

# 4. Drift Reduction Credit

If event reduces global drift:

```text
ΔD < 0
```

Then event has positive value.

---

# 5. Circuit Resolution Credit

If event eliminates circuit in matroid:

Value increases.

---

# 6. Convergence Contribution

Measured by:

```text
number_of_nodes_converged_after_event
```

---

# 7. Reputation Ledger

Nodes maintain:

```json
{
  "node_id": "0xabc...",
  "reputation_score": 0.742
}
```

Updated deterministically based on value function.

---

# 8. No Token Rule

System MUST NOT:

* mint tokens
* assign balances
* trade assets

Value is reputational and structural.

---

# 9. Incentive Model

Nodes seek:

* higher reputation
* stronger convergence centrality
* lower drift

Economic alignment = stability maximization.

---

# 10. Economic Invariant

> Value must derive from structural contribution, not speculative ownership.
