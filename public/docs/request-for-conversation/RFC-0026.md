# RFC-0026

# Formal Semantic Constitution v1.0

## Meta-Governance Layer for Semantic Worlds

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0023, RFC-0020

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines immutable meta-rules governing:

* policy changes
* drift thresholds
* closure registry updates
* federation rules
* governance model evolution

The Constitution is the layer above Policy.

---

# 2. Constitutional Structure

Each world W defines:

```text
C = (Foundational Invariants, Amendment Rules, Governance Scope)
```

---

# 3. Foundational Invariants

These MUST NOT change within a world:

1. basisHash immutability
2. replay determinism
3. proof validation requirement
4. drift metric formula (RFC-0008)
5. matroid independence definition

Violation requires world fork.

---

# 4. Amendment Mechanism

Amendments are declarative events:

```json
{
  "type":"constitutional_amendment",
  "proposal_id":"am-001",
  "changes":{
    "DRIFT_MAX":0.18
  },
  "justification_hash":"sha256-..."
}
```

---

# 5. Amendment Adoption Rule

An amendment is adopted iff:

```text
independent_set_hash converges across quorum_of_trusted_nodes
```

No voting — convergence-based legitimacy.

---

# 6. Meta-Governance Constraint

Policies (RFC-0023) must not violate Constitutional Invariants.

---

# 7. Constitutional Hash

```text
constitutionHash = sha256(
  basisHash
  + policy_set_hash
  + invariant_set
)
```

Included in worldHash.

---

# 8. Fork Trigger

If nodes disagree on amendment:

World forks under RFC-0022.

---

# 9. Constitutional Stability Principle

> A constitution defines what cannot change without creating a new world.

---

# 10. Legitimacy Metric

Measured by:

* convergence stability
* proof density
* absence of persistent circuits
