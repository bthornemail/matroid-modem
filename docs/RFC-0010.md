# RFC-0010

# Multi-Basis Federation Protocol v1.0

## Cross-Basis Semantic Coordination

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0001–0009

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how multiple basis systems federate without merging authority.

Federation is:

* cross-basis message exchange
* drift-evaluated alignment
* no global consensus

---

# 2. Federation Model

Each node:

* Maintains local basisHash
* Maintains closure registry
* Applies drift to foreign basis

---

# 3. Federation Message

```json id="n13"
{
  "type": "federation_event",
  "origin_basis": "basisA",
  "target_basis": "basisB",
  "event": { ... NDJSON record ... },
  "projection_coord": { "x":0.7,"y":0.2,"z":0.4,"w":0.125 }
}
```

---

# 4. Basis Alignment Function

Let:

```id="n14"
Φ : basisA → basisB
```

Mapping defined by:

* synset overlap
* coordinate similarity
* face algebra consistency

---

# 5. Federation Drift

Drift computed using RFC-0008 across basis projections.

If:

```id="n15"
D_total ≤ FEDERATION_THRESHOLD
```

Event admitted into local matroid ground set.

Else quarantined.

---

# 6. Federation Modes

| Mode         | Behavior                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| mirror       | accept all events          |
| drift-gated  | apply threshold            |
| observe-only | do not commit              |
| anchor-only  | accept only signed commits |

---

# 7. No Global Authority Rule

Federation MUST NOT:

* Override local basis
* Modify registry
* Auto-merge closures

---

# 8. Multi-Basis Projection Geometry

If two bases share w-space:

```id="n16"
colA = floor(wA*16)
colB = floor(wB*16)
```

Alignment if:

```id="n17"
|colA - colB| ≤ 1
```

---

# 9. Federation Invariant

> No federation event may alter replay determinism of local ledger prefix.

---

# 10. Security

Federation events MUST:

* include origin signature
* include registry_hash
* include drift report

---

# 11. Cross-Basis Circuit Detection

Conflicts across bases generate:

```json
{
  "type": "federation_circuit",
  "basisA_event": "...",
  "basisB_event": "...",
  "reason": "face conflict"
}
```

---

# 12. Scaling Model

Federation graph forms:

```id="n18"
Directed graph of basis nodes
```

Edges weighted by:

* drift mean
* event acceptance rate
