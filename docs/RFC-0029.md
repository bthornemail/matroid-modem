# RFC-0029

# Semantic Identity & Personhood Model v1.0

## Deterministic Identity in a Process-Centric World

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0014, RFC-0016, RFC-0025, RFC-0026

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how entities (human or agent) are:

* identified
* typed
* authorized
* attributed
* and persisted across worlds

Identity is semantic, not account-based.

---

# 2. Identity Object

An identity is a closure-stable semantic object:

```json
{
  "type": "semantic_identity",
  "identityHash": "sha256-...",
  "public_key": "0x...",
  "roles": ["author","validator"],
  "personhood_level": "human|agent|collective",
  "worlds": ["worldHash1","worldHash2"],
  "proofs": ["proofHash1","proofHash2"]
}
```

---

# 3. Identity Invariant

An identity is defined as:

```
identityHash = hash(public_key + canonical_type_profile)
```

No mutable attributes allowed.

Changes require new identity.

---

# 4. Personhood Levels

| Level      | Definition                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| human      | external biological agent                |
| agent      | deterministic closure VM                 |
| collective | aggregated independent set of identities |

Collectives are matroid-independent sets of identities.

---

# 5. Identity Capabilities

Capabilities are typed closures:

```json
{
  "capability":"propose_amendment",
  "scope":"worldHash",
  "drift_limit":0.15
}
```

---

# 6. Identity Persistence Across Worlds

An identity may exist in multiple worlds if:

* identityHash identical
* constitutional invariants compatible

Otherwise identity forks.

---

# 7. Identity Drift

Identity is considered unstable if:

```
drift(identity_behavior, declared_type_profile) > threshold
```

Triggers review (RFC-0027 reflection layer).

---

# 8. Identity Revocation

Revocation is:

```
independent_set_exclusion(identityHash)
```

Not deletion — exclusion from basis.

---

# 9. Personhood Proof

A personhood proof certifies:

* deterministic behavior (for agents)
* cryptographic control (for humans)
* independence stability (for collectives)

---

# 10. Identity Principle

> Identity is a stable closure under replay, not a mutable account record.
