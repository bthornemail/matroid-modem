# RFC-0021

# Canonical Narrative Time & Temporal Logic v1.0

## Deterministic Event Ordering and Temporal Reasoning

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0007

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines temporal model for narrative replay and semantic causality.

---

# 2. Time Types

```id="nt1"
Time ::= LogicalTime | WallClockTime
```

---

# 3. Logical Time

Each event assigned:

```id="nt2"
lc ∈ ℕ
```

Incremented per commit.

LogicalTime governs replay.

---

# 4. Wall Clock Time

```id="nt3"
t ∈ UNIX epoch
```

Used only for UI.

Never used in determinism.

---

# 5. Temporal Operators

Define operators:

```id="nt4"
◻ (always)
◇ (eventually)
→ (implies)
```

---

# 6. Event Temporal Formula

Example:

```id="nt5"
◻(synset_call → ◇ synset_reply)
```

Meaning: every call eventually yields reply.

---

# 7. Canonical Ordering Rule

Events ordered by:

```id="nt6"
(lc, self_hash)
```

Stable sorting required.

---

# 8. Time-Window Drift

Drift may include temporal delta:

```id="nt7"
D_time = |t_a - t_b| / MAX_WINDOW
```

Optional in federation.

---

# 9. Narrative Epochs

Define epoch:

```id="nt8"
epoch_id = hash(prefix_of_L)
```

Epoch changes when:

* registry changes
* basisHash changes

---

# 10. Temporal Invariant

Replay MUST ignore WallClockTime.

LogicalTime alone defines canonical order.

---

# 11. Time-Travel

Portal may:

* rewind ledger to lc = k
* recompute independent set
* recompute SAB

State at time k must be reproducible.
