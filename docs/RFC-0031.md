# RFC-0031

# Inter-World Treaty Framework v1.0

## Deterministic Federation Diplomacy

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0022, RFC-0026, RFC-0029

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how independent worlds:

* communicate
* exchange closures
* merge shards
* resolve conflicts

Without collapsing sovereignty.

---

# 2. Treaty Object

```json
{
  "type":"inter_world_treaty",
  "world_A":"hashA",
  "world_B":"hashB",
  "scope":{
    "closure_types":["civic_triple","economic_value"],
    "drift_cap":0.18
  },
  "validity_period":"temporal_logic_expression",
  "signatureA":"...",
  "signatureB":"..."
}
```

---

# 3. Treaty Conditions

Worlds must agree on:

* compatible semantic type systems
* compatible drift metrics
* compatible constitutional invariants

Else limited interoperability.

---

# 4. Cross-World Closure Exchange

Procedure:

1. Closure exported with proof certificate
2. Drift recalculated under receiving world's metric
3. If within cap → admitted
4. Else quarantined

---

# 5. Sovereignty Principle

Treaties do not alter:

* internal governance
* constitutional invariants
* identity definitions

Only define exchange boundary.

---

# 6. Conflict Resolution

If same closure produces different independence results:

```
dispute_event → bilateral matroid comparison
```

Outcome:

* accept under separate contexts
* or fork joint shard

---

# 7. Shared Shards

Worlds may create:

```
joint_world = merge(worldA, worldB, treaty_scope)
```

Governed by new constitution.

---

# 8. Treaty Termination

Triggered by:

* drift divergence beyond cap
* constitutional amendment incompatibility
* proof disagreement

---

# 9. Diplomatic Ledger

All treaty interactions logged as:

```
type: "treaty_event"
```

Replayable and verifiable.

---

# 10. Diplomacy Principle

> Worlds cooperate through typed closure exchange, not forced semantic unification.
