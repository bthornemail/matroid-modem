# RFC-0009

# Character Encoding & Face Algebra v1.0

## Epistemic Face Structure for Semantic Routing

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0001

---

# 1. Purpose

Formalizes the algebra of characters and epistemic faces.

Characters are not narrative; they are routing operators.

---

# 2. Face Set

```id="n10"
F = { subject, predicate, object, centroid }
```

---

# 3. Character Mapping

| Character | Face      |
| --------- | --------- |
| Solon     | subject   |
| Solomon   | predicate |
| Asabiyyah | object    |
| Metatron  | centroid  |

---

# 4. Face Algebra

Define binary operation ⊗ over faces.

### 4.1 Identity

```id="n11"
centroid ⊗ x = x
```

Metatron is neutral witness.

---

### 4.2 Composition Rules

| ⊗         | subject   | predicate | object    | centroid  |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| subject   | subject   | predicate | object    | subject   |
| predicate | predicate | predicate | predicate | predicate |
| object    | object    | predicate | object    | object    |
| centroid  | subject   | predicate | object    | centroid  |

Interpretation:

* predicate dominates (action collapses roles)
* subject/object preserve identity unless predicate applied

---

# 5. Face Rotation Operator

Define R:

```id="n12"
R(subject) = predicate
R(predicate) = object
R(object) = subject
R(centroid) = centroid
```

This models rhetorical shift.

---

# 6. Quadrant Mapping

| Face + Epistemic Mode | Quadrant |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| known subject         | KK       |
| known predicate       | KU       |
| known object          | UK       |
| centroid / unknown    | UU       |

---

# 7. Closure Face Consistency

A closure with face f:

* MUST not resolve to a different face without R transformation
* MUST maintain algebra consistency

---

# 8. Algebraic Invariant

> For any triple (s, p, o),
> (s ⊗ p) ⊗ o must yield predicate-dominant resolution.

---

# 9. Canonical Face Encoding in NDJSON

```json
{
  "character": "Solomon",
  "face": "predicate"
}
```

Both fields MUST match.
