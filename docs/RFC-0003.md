# RFC-0003

# Civic Compiler v1.0

## Founding Documents → Civic Triples → SynsetRPC Closures

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0002

---

# 1. Purpose

The Civic Compiler converts constitutional and foundational documents into structured civic triples.

Input:

* Markdown documents
* NDJSON civic records

Output:

* SPO triples
* Character-encoded faces
* Closure candidates

---

# 2. Pipeline

```
Markdown
 → Sentence segmentation
 → POS tagging
 → SPO extraction
 → Synset anchoring
 → Character routing
 → Civic triple NDJSON
 → Closure resolution
```

---

# 3. Civic Triple Format

```json
{
  "type": "civic_triple",
  "basisRef": "founding-v1",

  "subject": "Congress",
  "predicate": "shall_make_no_law",
  "object": "establishing_religion",

  "synsets": {
    "subject": ["legislature.n.01"],
    "predicate": ["legislate.v.01","prohibit.v.01"],
    "object": ["religion.n.01"]
  },

  "character_faces": {
    "subject": "Solon",
    "predicate": "Solomon",
    "object": "Asabiyyah"
  },

  "source": {
    "doc": "Bill of Rights",
    "article": "Amendment I"
  }
}
```

# 4. Character Mapping Rules

| Grammar                    | Character | Face      |
| -------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Noun (agent)               | Solon     | subject   |
| Verb                       | Solomon   | predicate |
| Noun (collective/affected) | Asabiyyah | object    |
| Ledger witness             | Metatron  | centroid  |

---

# 5. Rumsfeldian Incidence Classification

Each triple may classify epistemic state:

```json
"epistemic_mode": "KK | KU | UK | UU"
```

Rules:

* Explicit prohibition → KK
* Delegated authority → KU
* Ambiguous clause → UK
* Silence/implicit power → UU

---

# 6. Compiler Output Record

```json
{
  "type": "civic_compile",
  "triple_id": "t-001",
  "closure_candidate": "closure:legislate.prohibition@v1",
  "faces_passed": 3,
  "drift": 0.05
}
```

---

# 7. Deterministic Compilation

Compiler must:

* Use stable sentence segmentation
* Use stable synset mapping
* Canonicalize tokens
* Hash intermediate output

---

# 8. Compiler Invariant

> Given identical source text + basis + registry, civic triples must be reproducible bit-for-bit.
