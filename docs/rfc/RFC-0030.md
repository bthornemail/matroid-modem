# RFC-0030

# Epistemic Justice & Bias Correction Protocol v1.0

## Drift-Aware Fairness Mechanism

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0008, RFC-0025, RFC-0027

---

# 1. Purpose

Ensures semantic systems:

* do not accumulate structural bias
* do not silence minority but valid independent sets
* remain epistemically fair

Without introducing central authority.

---

# 2. Bias Definition

Bias exists when:

```
acceptance_rate(group_A) - acceptance_rate(group_B) > ε
```

Given equal drift and proof quality.

---

# 3. Group Definition

Groups defined by:

* identity role
* origin world
* proposal type
* semantic type cluster

Not demographic attributes.

---

# 4. Justice Metric

For group G:

```
J(G) = acceptance_rate(G) - expected_rate(G)
```

Expected rate derived from:

* drift distribution
* proof strength distribution
* independence score distribution

---

# 5. Bias Correction Mechanism

If |J(G)| > threshold:

System may:

* increase review depth
* lower drift tolerance for dominant group
* require higher proof density from dominant group

Never auto-accept.

---

# 6. Minority Protection Rule

If proposal:

* has low frequency
* high proof density
* low drift

It must not be suppressed solely by majority similarity clustering.

---

# 7. Circuit Fairness

Circuits involving same identity repeatedly trigger:

```
identity_bias_review(identityHash)
```

---

# 8. Reflection Integration

Bias metrics included in:

```json
{
  "type":"self_reflection",
  "justice_metrics": {...}
}
```

---

# 9. No Override Principle

Justice protocol cannot override matroid independence.

It adjusts evaluation thresholds, not truth.

---

# 10. Epistemic Justice Principle

> Fairness means equal evaluation under drift, proof, and independence constraints.
