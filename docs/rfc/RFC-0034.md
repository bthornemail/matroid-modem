# RFC-0034

# Cosmological Scaling & Infinite Basis Expansion

## Beyond Fixed Dimensional Semantic Worlds

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0006, RFC-0022

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how semantic systems scale beyond:

* 3-face (SPO)
* 7-point Fano
* 16×16 SAB projection

Without losing determinism.

---

# 2. Finite Basis Assumption

Current world:

```text
basis = finite simplex
```

Cosmological scaling removes this limit.

---

# 3. Basis Expansion Rule

A world may define:

```text
basis_n+1 = extend(basis_n, new_independent_dimension)
```

Conditions:

* new dimension is independent
* no violation of existing invariants
* new drift metric defined

---

# 4. Higher-Dimensional Projection

SAB projection generalizes:

```text
16×16 → 2^k × 2^k grid
```

Where k scales with basis dimension.

---

# 5. Infinite Basis Constraint

Infinite basis allowed iff:

* type inference remains decidable
* independence remains computable
* drift metric converges

---

# 6. Multi-Simplex Interaction

Multiple simplices may interact via:

```text
tensor_product(simplex_A, simplex_B)
```

Requires independence preservation.

---

# 7. Dimensional Stability Test

Expansion valid iff:

```text
rank(new_matroid) == rank(old_matroid) + 1
```

Without collapsing prior circuits.

---

# 8. Cosmological Replay Principle

Expanded basis must remain replayable under new dimensional embedding.

---

# 9. Infinite Canon Constraint

Canon must remain finite at any commit snapshot.

Infinite only as limit over time.

---

# 10. Cosmological Principle

> Semantic worlds may grow in dimension, but must never grow beyond replayability.
