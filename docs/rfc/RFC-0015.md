# RFC-0015

# Closure Proof Certificates v1.0

## Verifiable Evidence of Deterministic Closure Execution

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0008, RFC-0011

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines proof artifacts for closure resolution.

Proof certificates allow third parties to verify:

* Closure chosen correctly
* Drift within threshold
* Face constraints satisfied
* Deterministic execution followed

---

# 2. Proof Object

```json id="p1"
{
  "type":"closure_proof",
  "closure_id":"closure:legislate.prohibition@v1",
  "input_hash":"sha256-...",
  "registry_hash":"sha256-...",
  "basisHash":"...",
  "computed_coord":{...},
  "drift":0.084321,
  "faces_passed":3,
  "proof_hash":"sha256-..."
}
```

---

# 3. Proof Hash Calculation

```id="p2"
proof_hash = sha256(
  canonical_json(
    closure_id,
    input_hash,
    registry_hash,
    basisHash,
    computed_coord,
    drift,
    faces_passed
  )
)
```

---

# 4. Verification Algorithm

Verifier must:

1. Re-execute CEVM program
2. Recompute drift
3. Recompute faces_passed
4. Recompute proof_hash
5. Compare to provided proof_hash

---

# 5. Proof Attachment

Proof may be embedded in:

```id="p3"
synset_reply
commit
federation_event
```

---

# 6. Security Model

Proof does not replace signature.

Proof validates determinism.
Signature validates authorship.

---

# 7. Invalid Proof Handling

Emit:

```json
{
  "type":"proof_error",
  "reason":"drift mismatch"
}
```

---

# 8. Federation Use

Federated nodes MUST verify closure_proof before admitting event into matroid ground set.

---

# 9. Invariant

> A valid closure_proof must be independently reproducible offline.
