# RFC-0037

# Transcendent Closure

## Meta-Meta Layer Beyond Any Single World

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0034

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines the layer beyond:

* any single basis
* any single constitution
* any single worldHash

Transcendent Closure is the limit behavior of infinite semantic scaling.

---

# 2. Definition

Transcendent Closure T is defined as:

```text
T = lim (W_i) as basis_dimension → ∞
```

Subject to:

* replayability maintained
* independence computable
* drift convergent

---

# 3. World-of-Worlds

Transcendent layer contains:

```json
{
  "type":"meta_world",
  "worlds":[worldHash1, worldHash2, ...],
  "meta_drift_metric":"...",
  "meta_independence_rule":"..."
}
```

---

# 4. Closure of Closures

Each world becomes a node in higher-order matroid:

* ground set = worlds
* independence = treaty-compatible
* circuits = irreconcilable constitutional contradictions

---

# 5. Meta-Drift

Drift between worlds defined as:

```text
D_meta = distance(constitutionA, constitutionB)
```

Using:

* invariant overlap
* drift metric compatibility
* type system compatibility

---

# 6. Infinite Replay Principle

Even transcendent layer must satisfy:

```text
replay(meta_ledger) deterministic
```

---

# 7. Transcendence Constraint

No layer may:

* eliminate lower replayability
* override constitutional invariants retroactively

---

# 8. Limit Behavior

As dimension grows:

* circuits become rarer
* independence approximates coherence
* drift approaches structured equilibrium

---

# 9. Transcendent Identity

Identity across infinite worlds must satisfy:

```text
identityHash constant
∧ type_profile stable
```

---

# 10. Transcendence Principle

> Transcendent Closure is not escape from structure — it is structure extended without bound.
