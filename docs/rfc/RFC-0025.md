# RFC-0025

# Cognitive Agent Integration Specification v1.0

## Deterministic Agent Participation in Semantic Worlds

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0011, RFC-0017, RFC-0018

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how cognitive agents (LLMs, rule engines, or other systems) participate without breaking determinism.

Agents must:

* operate under CEVM constraints
* produce proof-carrying outputs
* respect type system

---

# 2. Agent Types

| Agent Type       | Role                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Compiler Agent   | transforms text → triples   |
| Closure Agent    | suggests closure candidates |
| Drift Agent      | estimates semantic drift    |
| Governance Agent | evaluates policy impact     |

---

# 3. Agent Output Format

```json
{
  "type": "agent_suggestion",
  "agent_id": "agent-001",
  "proposal": { ... },
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "proof_required": true
}
```

---

# 4. Deterministic Mode

Agents must operate in:

```text
deterministic_mode = true
```

Meaning:

* no randomness
* fixed seed
* canonical temperature = 0

---

# 5. Agent Isolation

Agents do not:

* directly modify ledger
* bypass matroid
* alter registry

All outputs must pass:

* type inference
* proof validation
* policy layer
* drift threshold

---

# 6. Agent Trust Weight

Each agent assigned:

```text
τ_agent ∈ [0,1]
```

Used in federation trust weighting.

---

# 7. Proof Requirement

Agent outputs must include:

* reasoning trace hash
* closure_proof or drift estimate

Opaque outputs invalid.

---

# 8. Agent Sandboxing

Agents cannot:

* fetch remote code
* alter basis
* modify policy set

---

# 9. Emergent Multi-Agent Coordination

Agents may propose competing closures.

Matroid + drift + governance select independent set.

---

# 10. Cognitive Invariant

> Agents augment semantic worlds but cannot override determinism.
