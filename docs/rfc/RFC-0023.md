# RFC-0023

# Semantic Governance & Policy Layer v1.0

## Deterministic Rule Enforcement Without Central Authority

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0020, RFC-0022

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how a semantic world enforces policy rules without:

* centralized moderators
* blockchain voting
* mutable authority

Governance is implemented as:

> Policy constraints evaluated over the independent set.

---

# 2. Governance Model

Each world W defines:

```text
G = (PolicySet P, Enforcement Rules E)
```

Policies are declarative constraints over:

* closure types
* drift bounds
* federation admission
* shard access
* narrative extensions

---

# 3. Policy Declaration Format

```json
{
  "policy_id": "no_unproven_closure",
  "scope": "closure_resolve",
  "constraint": {
    "require_proof": true,
    "max_drift": 0.15
  },
  "enforcement": "reject"
}
```

---

# 4. Policy Evaluation

During matroid admission:

```text
if event violates policy:
    apply enforcement rule
```

---

# 5. Enforcement Modes

| Mode           | Action                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| reject         | event excluded           |
| quarantine     | visible but not admitted |
| downgrade      | lower trust weight       |
| require_quorum | require N proofs         |

---

# 6. Governance Matroid Extension

Policy violations introduce artificial dependency edges:

```text
dependent(e) if violates_policy(e)
```

This prevents inclusion in independent set.

---

# 7. Governance Without Voting

No ballots.

Governance emerges via:

* shared policy sets
* drift convergence
* replay determinism

Nodes that reject policies diverge into forks (RFC-0022).

---

# 8. Governance Invariant

> Governance must not break replay determinism.

Policy evaluation must be deterministic.

---

# 9. Policy Versioning

Policies are part of:

```text
worldHash
```

Policy changes require fork.

---

# 10. Legitimacy Model

Legitimacy is:

* policy adoption rate
* drift alignment
* proof density
* convergence stability

Not token-weighted votes.
