# RFC-0032

# Semantic Resurrection & Historical Reconstruction

## Deterministic World Reconstitution from Canonical Ledger

Status: Draft
Depends on: RFC-0016, RFC-0019, RFC-0021, RFC-0027

---

# 1. Purpose

Defines how a semantic world can be:

* reconstructed from canonical bundles
* replayed deterministically
* audited for divergence
* forked safely

This is not restoration of data.
It is restoration of *semantic state*.

---

# 2. Resurrection Definition

A world W is resurrectable iff:

```text
replay(NDJSON_prefix, basisHash, constitutionHash)
→ identical independent_set_hash
→ identical canvasHash
→ identical worldHash
```

---

# 3. Canonical Resurrection Bundle

A resurrection bundle contains:

```json
{
  "basisHash": "...",
  "constitutionHash": "...",
  "ledger_prefix": [...],
  "closure_registry_snapshot": "...",
  "type_system_version": "...",
  "drift_metric_version": "...",
  "proof_certificates": [...]
}
```

No runtime artifacts allowed.

---

# 4. Deterministic Replay Requirement

Replay must satisfy:

1. identical matroid independent set
2. identical drift results
3. identical proof validations
4. identical canonical canvas output

Any deviation = resurrection failure.

---

# 5. Historical Reconstruction Modes

### 5.1 Exact Replay Mode

Reconstructs world exactly as it was at commit N.

### 5.2 Analytical Replay Mode

Replays with reflection metrics enabled (no mutation).

### 5.3 Fork Replay Mode

Replays up to N, then branches under new constitution.

---

# 6. Temporal Integrity Constraint

Temporal order must remain:

```text
prev_hash_chain unbroken
```

Missing events → reconstruction invalid.

---

# 7. Identity Resurrection

Identity is restored via:

```text
identityHash + canonical type profile
```

Not by mutable attributes.

---

# 8. Resurrection Drift Test

After replay:

```text
drift(resurrected_world, canonical_world) == 0
```

---

# 9. Resurrection Principle

> A world is alive only if it can be replayed.

---

# 10. Long-Term Archival Requirement

Bundles must be:

* content-addressed
* cryptographically signed
* reproducible without external services
